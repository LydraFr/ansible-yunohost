# Ansible Role: Yunohost

[üá´üá∑ French version](README-FR.md)

Deploy [Yunohost](https://yunohost.org/#/) with Ansible!

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Default variables are available in `default/main.yml` however it is necessary to override them according to your needs for Yunohost domains, users and apps.

### SMTP relay configuration

```yml
ynh_smtp_relay:
    host: smtp.domain.tld
    port: 25
    user: user1
    password: Pa$$w0rd
```

There is a built-in SMTP server on Yunohost but you can also set up Yunohost to use a SMTP relay instead.
In order to do so, create the `ynh_smtp_relay` variable in order to provide your own values. You can learn more about SMTP relay [here](https://yunohost.org/en/administrate/specific_use_cases/email_relay).

### Updates configuration

```yml
# Autoupdate Yunohost and its apps
ynh_autoupdate:
  scheduled: True
  special_time: "daily" #Choices are [annually,daily,hourly,monthly,reboot,weekly,yearly]
  apps: True
  system: True
  dest_script: "/usr/bin/"
```

A cron job can been set up to automate the check for system and application updates on a schedule of your choice.

- `ynh_autoupdate.scheduled` : enables the cron job by setting the value to `True`.
- `ynh_autoupdate.special_time`: it is mandatory. It allows you to specify when you want this task to be executed. Possible values: (`annually`,`daily`,`hourly`,`monthly`,`reboot`,`weekly`,`yearly`). To learn more about special times, click [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/cron_module.html).
- `ynh_autoupdate.apps`: is mandatory. Enables automatic updating of Yunohost applications by setting the value to `True`.
- `ynh_autoupdate.system`: is mandatory. Enables automatic updating of the Yunohost system by setting the value to `True`.
- `ynh_autoupdate.dest_script`: it is the path to the directory where the update script will be installed on the server. The default value is `/usr/local/bin`. The script is named `ynh_autoupdate.sh`.

If available, updates are done automatically. In case of problems following an application update, you can read logs located in `/var/log/yunohost/categories/operation` . You also have the possibility to rollback to the previous version since Yunohost always makes an automatic backup of an application when it is updated.

To learn more about how updates work in Yunohost you can go [here](https://yunohost.org/fr/update). The changelog of Yunohost versions is also available [here](https://forum.yunohost.org/tag/ynh_release).

### SSH port modification

Among the settings available in YunoHost, it is possible to change the SSH port. You just have to create the `ynh_ssh_port` variable and the role will retrieve the SSH port and modify it if necessary. It will also perform the adequate modifications regarding fail2ban and the internal firewall of YunoHost.
In your YunoHost host is behind a firewall, you may consider creating the appropriate security group.

``yml
ynh_ssh_port: "812"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful, from the moment the SSH port is modified, the next time you want to connect to the YunoHost server with SSH, you will have to specify the SSH port to be used (for example `ssh -p 812 username@hostname`). You can also externalize this configuration to an SSH configuration file (more info [here](https://linuxize.com/post/using-the-ssh-config-file/)). You can indicate that configuration in your inventory file otherwise Ansible won't be able to connect to your server. (More info [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/faq.html#how-do-i-handle-different-machines-needing-different-user-accounts-or-ports-to-log-in-with)).

## Dependencies
